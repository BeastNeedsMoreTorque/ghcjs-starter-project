# GHCJS Starter Project

See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for terms of use.

Made by [Chris Allen](http://bitemyapp.com) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitemyapp)), author of the book [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com).

This is intended to be a _bare_ starter project. If I make new ones with examples/bindings to other frameworks, I'll make other git respositories and link them here.
